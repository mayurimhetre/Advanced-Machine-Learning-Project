# Enhancing the Explainability and Fairness of Tree Ensembles   

This repository contains my academic work for the **Advanced Machine Learning** course, focused on understanding, analyzing, and presenting the research paper:

**“On Enhancing the Explainability and Fairness of Tree Ensembles”**  
by Carrizosa, Kurishchenko, and Romero Morales (2025).

The goal of this repository is to document my **conceptual understanding** of the paper through a structured presentation and the original research reference.

### 1. **AML_Presentation.pdf**
A detailed presentation created by me to explain the core ideas of the paper in a clear and structured manner.  
The presentation covers:

- Motivation and limitations of traditional tree ensembles
- Explainable and Fair Tree Ensemble (EFTE) methodology
- Mixed Integer Linear Optimization (MILO) formulation
- Fairness-aware objective function
- Conservative prediction rule with slack variables
- Experimental setup and datasets
- Results comparison with Random Forest
- Key conclusions and future research directions

This file reflects **my interpretation and understanding** of the paper, prepared for academic presentation.
